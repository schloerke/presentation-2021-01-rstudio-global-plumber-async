Steps
1. Audience Rules
  - Audience Profiles
    - rstudio::global
      - Technical conference
      - Users want to come away with a new idea or technique for everyday life
        - Basic users to technical users. Wide spectrum.
      - Hadley: "Your problem has a name and can use this tool that I've help develop"

2. Your Governing Idea
  - Bring only a masterpiece, not your whole gallery
  - What is the one idea you want to leave with the audience?
  - What is at stake for the audience inside your idea?
  - Whay should they care? ... So what?
  - What do you want the audience to do with the idea when they leave the room? (Call to action)

  Eli demo:
    Cause: Information filter of relevance
    Effect: Unbalanced Access
    Impact / Why: Functioning Democracy

3. Proof / Support
  - What proof and support is necessary to bring "truth" to your idea?
  - What context does your audience need?
  - What will you need to "ladder" or "segment" for your audience to understand that proof?
    - (for complex scientific or research talks)

  - Eli demo:
    - context: imformation filter bubbles
    - impact: balance of information
    - call to action: ethical curators

  - Points of support need to be unique

4. Connecting Ideas to the Audience
  - What examples, metaphores or stories can you use bring resonation to the idea?
  - Is there a demonstation or animation possible?

  - Eli demo:
    - context: facebook / google
    - impact: netflix / junk food
    - call to action: gatekeepers / user control

  - Use the senses!
    - Sights, sounds, feels, smells, tastes
  - Seques of a discreet story
    - Context: time / place / characters
    - Actions
    - Results: outcome / lesson

  - Connecting with the audience
    - What of yourself have you brought into the talk?
    - Can you show a human / personal side that demonstates your passion or any vulnerablility?

5. Building the talk Outline
  - With the idea, proof and stories in hand, it is now tim eto "sequence" the talk - or build the outline.
  - Openings and closing are most important
  - Timing matters - are you considering the time limit you have been given?

  - Outline example:
    - opening hook
    - governing idea
    - why / villain
    - support 1
    - support 2
    - support 3
    - call to action
    - close

6. Visuals
  - Minimize the number of words on the screen
    - Much easier to focus
  - people will watch on their mobile device
    - Can't look at print / small text
    - Use large images
    - ... bullet point is dead for rstudio::global
      - work on storyline first, then visuals

7. Practicing the talk
  - Voice Memos from outline
  - Script only if necessary - reduce back to outline
  - Pausing / Pacing / Breath and other style and delivery elements
  - Memorize open, close, and transitions

8. Virutal Delivery
  - "THINKING is to humans as swimming is to cats; they _can_ do it, but they _prefer_ not to." - Daniel Kahneman

For the first group session:
  - Answer the question and provide values for the cause, effect, and impact/why
    - What is the idea that you want to leave with the audience?
    - By doing X (cause), we get Y (effect), for Z (impact/why)



20 mins is the max. Does not mean that you need to use it all.
