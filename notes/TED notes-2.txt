Core idea: Use all available cores on your machine to make your server faster
Core idea; Use your hosted

By leveraging asynchronous routes (via {future} and {promises}), we can unblock the main execution thread.
  why:
    This will allow for other API routes to execute while slower routes can return immediately
  how to show this:
    Demo of a slow route and a fast route waiting for the slow route to finish
    Demo of a slow ASYNC route and a fast route NOT waiting for the slow async route to finish
  imagery:
    Single construction work doing the work while 9 other supervisors watch
    Copy paste the single construction worker 10x times (and remove the supervisors)

  provide a 10s example and another 10s example

Benefit:
  helps R scale

  this is not a silver bullet, there is a downside
    fast routes are made slower when moving the simple computation to another core
