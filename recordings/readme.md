Barret Schloerke
plumber + future: Async Web APIs

Videos:
* All videos are numbered in their presentation order
* I did not know if questions was to be included...
  * Feel free to stop videos at the ending slide (8-barret-closer.mov) before questions if I am to do questions "live"

Screen cap:
* 0-barret-screencap is a single shot screen cap of all the videos playing in the background in order
* If you have uniform title pages for everyone... I would LOVE if you provided a title page or removed mine completely.
  * I really miss your rstudio conf template. :-)

Extras:
* I have included stills of each build
* I have included the keynote.

Please let me know if there is anything I can help out with. This was 100x anxiety inducing than a large conference talk but really exciting to see come together.

Thank you,
Barret
